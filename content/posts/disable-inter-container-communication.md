## TL;DR;

Here I learn how the `--link` arg is now legacy and that `icc=false` is a recommended security practice as it disables communications on the default bridge network.  To allow containers to communicate with icc=false you need to use custom networks.

## Longer version

Disabling inter-container communication (icc) forces any containers to have explicit links with those it needs to communicate with.  This is a setting on the docker daemon itself and the setting can be applied in the `systemd` configuration.

To setup this example I have created a toy app called todos with very simple functionality.  I have split the project into two containers:

1. The Proxy - this is the existing work with nginx
2. The Todos App - this is a small go app to create, update and list todos

The idea is that there will be two container instances running - one for nginx and one for the todo app; a custom config is then supplied to nginx to proxy all calls to the todos app.  The nginx container instance will be the only one with any port mappings.

I wont detail all the code for the sample app or the nginx configuration, that can be found in the repository here [https://github.com/reaandrew/nginx-security](https://github.com/reaandrew/nginx-security)

### Setting up the two container instances

I have updated the Makefile to include the todos container.

```Makefile
.PHONY: build
build:
	docker build -t reaandrew/nginx-secure ./proxy
	(cd todos && go build -o todos main.go)
	docker build -t reaandrew/todos-secure ./todos

.PHONY: run
run: build
	docker run --name todos-secure --read-only \
		-d -t reaandrew/todos-secure

	docker run --name nginx-secure --read-only \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/proxy_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/client_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/fastcgi_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/uwsgi_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/scgi_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/nginx,tmpfs-size=1m \
		--link todos-secure:todos \
		-d -p 8080:8080 -t reaandrew/nginx-secure


.PHONY: kill
kill:
	docker kill nginx-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker rm nginx-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker kill todos-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker rm todos-secure 2> /dev/null || :


.PHONY: logs
logs:
	docker logs nginx-secure
	docker logs todos-secure
```

~~The important part is the addition of an explicit link `--link todos-secure:todos`.  This allows the nginx container to reference a host name of todos which you can see in the following nginx config snippet:~~

Later on I update this as this doesnt work when icc=false and is actually now a legacy approach.

```conf
...
    location / {
       proxy_pass   http://todos:8080;
    }
...
```

Also note that no ports have been exposed for the todos app, only the nginx container.

### Testing out the ICC switch

#### Before disabling ICC

To test this I am shelling into a busybox container and trying to consume the todos app directly, not via the nginx container.

Refresh the containers, kill and re-run.
```shell
make kill
make run
```

Review the containers which are running:

```shell
> docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
da33f3a2bf52   reaandrew/nginx-secure   "/usr/sbin/nginx -g â€¦"   43 seconds ago   Up 42 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp   nginx-secure
2b7afded4cdf   reaandrew/todos-secure   "/usr/bin/todos"         43 seconds ago   Up 42 seconds                                               todos-secure
```

I want to start a new container which has a shell and some tools so I can test out inter container communication without using explcit links.  Before I do this I need to know what the IP is of the todo container.

```shell
> docker inspect todos-secure | jq -r '.[]|.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress'
172.17.0.2
```

Now I have the IP I can start the other container, shell in and try to consume the todos list endpoint which should return an empty array.

```shell
> docker run -it --rm busybox
> wget -qO- 172.17.0.2:8080/todos
[]
```
Success, this shows we can communicate between containers, but I want to disable this.

#### After disabling ICC

To disable the inter-container communication you need to add an argument to the docker systemd file `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` (the location may be different on your setup.)  The ExecStart line from that file should look like the following:

```unit file (systemd)
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --icc=false -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock 
```

Now reload the systemd daemon since the content of the file has changed and restart the docker daemon.

```shell
> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
> sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Now when I try to consume the todos from the busybox I am expecting the process to hang since the inter-container communication has been disabled, but for the demo I will set a timeout to show it failing.

```shell
> make kill
> make run
> docker inspect todos-secure | jq -r '.[]|.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress'
172.17.0.2
> docker run -it --rm busybox
> wget -T 2 -qO- 172.17.0.2:8080/todos
wget: download timed out
```

Now hitting the todos API from the host, the way it is intended to be used is also hanging!!

```shell
> curl -m 2 -v localhost:8080/todos
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /todos HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.74.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Operation timed out after 2003 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
* Closing connection 0
curl: (28) Operation timed out after 2003 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
```

**THIS DOESN'T WORK!!!**

### How to fix this and keep Inter-Container Communication disabled?

Turns out `--link` is now legacy along with the default bridge which I have used above.  The recomendation now is to use user-defined networks with docker including (for this example) user-defined bridges.  So the final steps are to create a custom bridge network, attach the two containers and see if the todos api can be consumed from the host.

Here is the update Makefile:

```Makefile
.PHONY: build
build:
	docker build -t reaandrew/nginx-secure ./proxy
	(cd todos && go build -o todos main.go)
	docker build -t reaandrew/todos-secure ./todos

.PHONY: run
run: build
	docker network create --driver bridge appz

	docker run --name todos-secure --read-only \
		--network appz \
		-d -t reaandrew/todos-secure

	docker run --name nginx-secure --read-only \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/proxy_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/client_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/fastcgi_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/uwsgi_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/scgi_temp,tmpfs-size=2m \
		--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/nginx,tmpfs-size=1m \
		--network appz \
		-d -p 8080:8080 -t reaandrew/nginx-secure


.PHONY: kill
kill:
	docker kill nginx-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker rm nginx-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker kill todos-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker rm todos-secure 2> /dev/null || :
	docker network rm appz


.PHONY: logs
logs:
	docker logs nginx-secure
	docker logs todos-secure

```

The changes to the Makefile include:

1. Create the network  Also update the kill target to remove the network
2. Remove the `--link` from the nginx container and instead attach both containers to the new `appz` network.

The other change required is the hostname which nginx uses to reference the upstream service.  Before I defined this as `todos` but now this has changed to the name given to the container `todos-secure`.

The updated block in the nginx configuration file is now:

```conf
...
    location / {
       proxy_pass   http://todos-secure:8080;
    }
...
```

### Finally!

And now when the endpoint is hit from the host we get the correct response.

```shell
> curl -m 2 -v localhost:8080/todos
[]
```
